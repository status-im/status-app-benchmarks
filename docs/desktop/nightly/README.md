# Windows — performance benchmarks

Automated test suite performance tracking for the Windows desktop app.
Charts show data from the last 30 days — each point is one nightly run.
Load-time charts plot the average of runs per build. Lower is better.

> **Viewing charts:** Open the linked interactive charts below, or use the
> [dashboard](https://status-im.github.io/status-app-benchmarks/desktop/) on GitHub Pages.

Full CSV history: [`data/`](../../data/).

> **Baseline note:** A full 2.38.0 (`5f66de`) re-baseline is not available — benchmark user profiles are incompatible with the 2.38.0 binary, and wallet tab tests now wait for tab content. Nightly trend continues; non-tab scenarios still compare to 2.38.0 where valid. When **2.39.0** ships, **2.38.2** becomes the new baseline — see [`BASELINE_2.39.md`](./BASELINE_2.39.md).

**Last run** · Sep 17, 2026 · [`ad63eabb5`](https://github.com/status-im/status-app/commit/ad63eabb5202c22415e0413867e32f2bfaa12829)

## Scenario summary

Latest result for every tested scenario. Speed categories:

**<0.5s Fast** · **0.5–0.9s Ok** · **0.9–1.0s Near ok** · **>1.0s Slow**

Reference parity (where shown) means the latest value is within ±15% of 2.38.0. Wallet tab scenarios show **no baseline** because the e2e test now waits for tab content (Jul 2026).
